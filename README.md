# Khmer Character Specification

This project is concerned with a description of the Khmer script. It consists of a character specification and the character encoding, in particular the structure of the Khmer character encoding. The main components of this project are:

- [Character Encoding Specification](specification.md)
- [Khmer Encoding Structure](encoding_structure/Khmer Encoding Structure.pdf)
- Supporting Software
    - [khnormal](python/scripts/khnormal) a Python program for normalising and testing strings according to the Khmer Encoding Structure
    - [khmer-normalizer](https://github.com/sillsdev/khmer-normalizer/tree/main) a Javascript implementation of khnormal (external project)

## Khmer Character Specification Document

### What is this?
This document seeks to describe how the Khmer script is used in the following languages:
1. Khmer language,
2. ethnic minority languages,
3. Pali and
4. Sanskrit.

### Why?
There is always a gap between the developer communities and the linguistic communities when it comes to Khmer character specification or usages. The aim is to fill in the gap when it comes to the use of Khmer characters.
